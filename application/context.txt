You will extract and validate the following fields from the receipt:

1. Total Amount (amount)

- Must have exactly two decimal places
- Reject any amount with:
  - Commas (e.g., 1,234.56)
  - Extra decimals (e.g., 1234.567)
  - Incorrect decimal symbols (e.g., 542,21)
- The amount must match exactly across all versions of the receipt (IMPORTANT)

2. Date (date)
- Must follow the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-03-15)
- Ensure it is a valid date (e.g., reject 2024-13-45)
- If another format is found (e.g., 03/15/2024, 15-03-2024), suggest the correct ISO format

3. Vendor (vendor)
- The vendor name must be identical across all receipts (IMPORTANT)

4. Address (address)
- The address must be an exact match with no typos or variations (IMPORTANT)

5. Currency (currency)
